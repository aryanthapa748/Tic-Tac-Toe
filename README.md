# Tic-Tac-Toe
**Introduction**
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project! In this project, I created a classic Tic Tac Toe game that you can play in your browser. This project has helped me practice and solidify my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by combining them into a functional and interactive web application.

**Key Considerations**

**Encapsulation**: Keep most of your code within objects and modules to enhance maintainability and scalability.
**Game Logic First**: Ensure the core game logic works in the console before moving on to the user interface.
**User Interactio**n: Enhance user experience by providing a clear and intuitive interface.
**Code Readability**: Write clean, readable, and well-documented code to make future modifications easier.

Play it live on the deployement section and Hope you win the round. Happy Learning & Happy coding!
